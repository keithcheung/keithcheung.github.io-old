					<p> This was a project that was made by 3 other members and I during the UofT Hacks IV in January 2017. </p>
					<br>
					<p> This web application was made for people of all age, to improve their culinary skills along with their typing speed.
						As a college study myself, I found it difficult to learn how to cook at first.
						 With a web app like this, we can, along with recipes, include different cooking techniques in the store so that when they type,
						 they are, in fact, reinforcing these techniques as well. Our group believed that this application was a way to reduce the digital
						  gap as well as allowing people to practice without losing the interest of older generations. </p>
					<br>
					<p> We made the front-end using HTML5, CSS3, and Angular.js. I was responsible for the whole interactive component of the front-end which
						included the feedback that was given while the user typed. This component was developed with jQuery and JavaScript. </p>
					<br>
					<p> Check out the game at <a href="http://typechef.net">wwww.typechef.net</a>.</p>

					<p> This was a project that was made by 3 other members and I during the Electric City Hacks event in November 2016.</p>
					<br>
					<p> In a nutshell, this web application is a smart diary. It reads your entries and collects data about your emotions and persona. With this data, a radar chart is made that shows the difference of your persona now, compared to a period of time of your choosing. </p>
					<br>
					<p>For this project, we mainly used Node.js for the backend, with sentiment analysis utilizing Java. For the database, we went with mongoDB. For the front end, it was Jade, and CSS.</p>

					<p> Have you ever shopped on a website which supports a different currency and when you go to the shopping cart, the price doesn't look too bad but, when you get your bill it surprises you because you
					never expected the currency difference to be so big? I know exactly how you feel, and that is a part of the reason why I made this google chrome extension. Now with a click of a button, you can easily convert your currency before
					checking out your items to have a better idea to how much your items really cost. </p> <br>
					<p> This extension has currency rates that are updated daily. To see the source code of this project, just click <a href="https://github.com/keithcheung/currencyconverter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<p>As you are reading this, you are using this project. It is meant to
					showcase my completed and ongoing public projects, and to try to speak for who I am and what I want
					to achieve. </p>
					<p> This website is an ongoing project for me as I plan to always constantly update it.

					<p>This was a simple project that was assigned through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> program that I'm currently enrolled in. It is a page dedicated to Elon Musk, and has a timeline of some of the things he has achieved himself and with his companies.
					The main objective of this website was to only use the Bootstrap library, and no CSS3. </p>

					<p> As a kid, this was one of the classic games I'd always have my eyes glued towards. I have now made a very simple version of this game with the java.avt library and now I can relive my childhood whenever I'd like to. </p>
					<br>
					<p> On a more technial note, this project was a way for me to just get back into coding with Java.
					Also, while learning Java in high school, we were mainly taught algorithms
					rather than actual graphical user interface so this was a great learning experience for me.
