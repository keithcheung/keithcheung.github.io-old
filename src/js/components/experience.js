            During my most recent internship at HubSpot, I was on the customer
            relations managerâ€™s communicator team. Our team was is in charge of
            120,000 daily interactions between company representatives and their
            customers. We played a huge role in the interactions that help build
            a customer base for companies to grow better.

            During my previous internship at HubSpot, I was on the subscriptions

            customers to gain insights on their email campaign.
