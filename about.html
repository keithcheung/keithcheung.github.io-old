				<h3>about me</h3>
				<p>I am a first year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. I have an interest in basically
				everything that has a front and/or back-end enviornment, whether it's implemented in hardware, or embbedded within webpages, I am intrigued
				by the developement process and am eager to learn more about it. </p>
				<br>
				<p>During my years at Milliken Mills High School, I discovered my passion for programming. What I love about programming is the fact that the possibilities are endless. You're able to make your imagination into a reality, and the sense of fulfillment you get from doing this is indescribable.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Some of my interests include travelling, reading, watching videos, weightlifting, and playing sports such as volleyball and ultimate frisbee.</p>
