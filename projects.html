			<div id = "panel2"><p>As you are reading this, you are using this project. It is meant to
			showcase my completed and ongoing public projects, and to try to speak for who I am and what I want
			to achieve. </p>
			<p> This website is mainly composed of Bootstrap which is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework and uses a little bit of the jQuery library.
			If you'd like to see the source code, just <a href = "https://github.com/keithcheung/website" target = "_blank">click here</a>.</p>

			<div id ="panel"><p>This was a simple project that was assigned through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> program that I'm currently enrolled in. It is a page dedicated to Elon Musk, and has a timeline of some of the things he has achieved himself and with his companies.
				The main objective of this website was to only use the Bootstrap library, and no CSS3. </p> 
				<br>
				<p>It can be seen by <a href="https://codepen.io/keithcheung41/full/zBKXrP/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>

			<div id ="panel3"><p> As a kid, this was one of the classic games I'd always have my eyes glued towards. I have now made a very simple version of this game with the java.avt library and now I can relive my childhood whenever I'd like to. </p>
			<br>
			<p> On a more technial note, this project was a way for me to just get back into coding with Java. 
				Also, while learning Java in high school, we were mainly taught algorithms
				rather than actual graphical user interface so this was a great learning experience for me.

			<div id = "panel4"><p> Have you ever shopped on a website which supports a different currency and when you go to the shopping cart, the price doesn't look too bad but however, when you get your bill it surprises you because you
			never expected the currency exchange to be so large? I know exactly how you feel, and that is a part of the reason why I made this google chrome extension. Now with a click of a button, you can easily convert your currency before
			checking out your items to have a better idea to how much your items really cost. </p> <br>
			<p> This extension has currency rates that are updated daily. To see the source code of this project, just click <a href="https://github.com/keithcheung/currencyconverter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
