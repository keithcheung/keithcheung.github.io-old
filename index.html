				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a first year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. I have an interest in basically
				everything that has a back-end enviornment, whether it's implemented in hardware, or embbedded within webpages I am intrigued
				by back-end developement and would love to learn more about it. </p>
					<br>
				<p>During my years at Milliken Mills High School, I discovered my passion for programming. What I love about programming is the fact that you're able to make your imagination into a reality, and the sense of fulfillment you get from doing this is indescribable.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Some of my interests include playing games with my friends (League of Legends, Overwatch, H1Z1), surfing the web, watching videos, reading, and weightlifting.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For those of you interested in my resume, that can be viewed <a href="keith.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<h2>What I Do</h2>
				<h4><strong>VISION:</strong> I aspire to become a software developer.</h4>
				<p>Currently, my main focus is developing web developement skills to design more interactive websites. With that being said, web applications are also an
				option. After focusing on web developement, I do want to experiment
			and focus more on application developement. Whether that will be on iOS or Andriod is still yet to be determined. </p>
